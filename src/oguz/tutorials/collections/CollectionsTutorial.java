    The Collection interface does about what you'd expect given that a Collection represents a group of objects.
    It has methods that tell you how many elements are in the collection (size, isEmpty), methods that check whether a
    given object is in the collection (contains), methods that add and remove an element from the collection
    (add, remove), and methods that provide an iterator over the collection (iterator).
